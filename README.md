This repository documents a project experimenting with Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques towards the goal of predicting wholesale electric prices.

Many online resources claim to be able to construct machine learning and deep learning models that can predict stock price data. While the very existence of these blogs suggests that they do not perform better than alternative techniques, I was searching for an opportunity to develop my own understanding and figured that perhaps they might perform well enough for a university project.
